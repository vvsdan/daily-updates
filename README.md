This repo/README file is meant to serve as a journey for documenting work I do daily, problems solved, tasks completed, or challenges faced in my learning.

In the comfy store project, there was a NaN error being produced when adding items to the cart. In the web application, the error appeared in the Navbar Cart icon which was to indicate the number of items in the cart. The same error carried over for other dynamic values such as in the checkout page, when calculating the shipping totals (everything produced NaN except the static shipping price). 
Initially, I thought this error was in the store.js file OR the cartSlice.js file where state values were stored, or being incremented, edited, etc. 
Solution: In App.jsx the path for "Orders" was incorrect

### 2 Jan 2024

Spent some of the day reviewing the end of Jose Portilla's SQL course. Reviewed topics of NULLIF, Views, and Import-Export of files. 
Went back to work on the Comfy Store and the bug resurfaced. Tried to look through code to see areas of error. Still thinking that this error must occur right upon action dispatch.
Will try again when possible, will maybe try utilizing breakpoints to pin point the error. Just as before, cart icon is returning NaN, as are the cart totals.

### 3 Jan 2024 

Didn't have a chance to make meaningful progress - was asked to come into work as the team was short staffed today. 
Will continue bugfixing, and ideally make meaningful progress with Power Bi.

### 4 Jan 2024 

No luck with bugfixing today, and in order to finish the project it needs to be completed. 
To try again this weekend.
Progress made with Power BI: 
Learning the difference (and similarities) between it and Excel -- also noting that they're built on top of the same analytics engine. 
High level overiew of "Back-end" (Power Query Editor) and "Front-end" (Model view, data view, and report view) workflow.
Went over different types of data connectors (flat files, databases, azire, online services, etc.) to see what is available. Will be working with .csv files for the course though. 
Completed an introductory quiz:
